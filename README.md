# blog-gitflow-maven

Exmaple project for the [Automating Semantig Versioning](https://viesure.io/automating-semantic-versioning-with-maven) blog post.

------

All commands are found in the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.

You can test the different commands locally by simply executing them in any shell.
You don't need maven to try out the different commands, the repository comes with maven wrapper (just execute `./mvnw` instead).

The project can be taken and uploaded to Gitlab as is to test out the different pipeline jobs.
